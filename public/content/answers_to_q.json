        "<Trilogy by The Weeknd—it changed the landscape of RnB forever by bringing a raw, dark sound which relied on simplicity of production, whilst paying attention to the tiny details. I fell in love with the raw honesty and the intentional production behind each song. Not a single sonical second wasted.>",
        "<Fundamentally speaking—Attention is All You Need; but I honestly think it’s An Integrated Brain-Machine Interface Platform With Thousands of Channels; the single greatest contribution to direct human augmentation via technology. The creation of a high-density neural interface which can read from and write to our brains is a major step to the future of human-computer intersection; because I believe we shouldn’t replace humans with technology, but rather use technology to augment ourselves.>",
        "<Paleontology—if we don’t have a concrete understanding of our past, how can we ever build to the future? Studying the intricacies of the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous feels like a deep dive into an era we’ll never get to truly witness; we are limited by the State of the Art, and at most we can guess and make increasingly educated guesses.>",

Incomparably opulent art of all disciplines reside in its walls, each a testament to expertise, craft, and sustained toil, made more astounding for being created in the 17th century. And its cultural participation through five centuries of French culture cement Versailles’ status as the most consequential artwork in the world (at least, that I’ve seen).>",

        "<The greatest contribution to art I've seen is the creation of Photoshop in the medium of digital design. Before Photoshop, art was mainly physical, consisting of paint, ink, film, and sculpture. Photoshop allowed artists to manipulate pixels instead of pigments, and wasn't just a new tool, but rather a new space for creativity to blossom without the limits of traditional material. Photoshop blurs the lines between different art mediums, with a photographer now being able to paint or a painter manipulating photos. The walls between different disciplines were thrown out of the equation. To me, the creation of Photoshop isn't just the invention of some mere tool, but rather the invention of a new canvas for human imagination, creativity, and connection.>",
        "<For me, the most impactful research paper since 2000 is 'Usability Evaluation Considered Harmful (Some of the Time),' by Saul Greenberg and Bill Buxton, published in 2008. Until then, usability testing was considered a must for evaluating interactive products. This paper argued that constantly testing, especially during the early stages of the design process, could actually harm innovation, discourage risk, and prevent designers from pushing boundaries. Instead of trading usability as the ultimate goal, Saul Greenberg and Bill Buxton pushed for a field where design was balanced between innovation, creativity, and usability. 'Imperfect' designs early on allow for great ideas to blossom with time. This paper allowed teams to embrace risky prototypes and delay judgments until after exploring imaginative and broad design directions. Greenberg and Buxton shifted UX research away from strictly fixing problems and rather nurturing out-of-the-box ideas, expanding the role of UX in product innovation.>",
        "<Astronomy fascinates me, since it's the study of everything beyond the land we live on: planets, galaxies, and the structure of the universe itself, and more. Astronomy stretches across billions of years and billions of light-years, tapping into mysteries that I wonder (Where did everything come from? Are we currently alone?). Astronomy looks forward to space travel, the face of the Earth, and even the fate of the universe. Overall, Astronomy grounds me, allowing me to understand how small I am amid the unknowable. >",
        "<I’d choose to live in Classical Athens during the Golden Age, which was a time when art and philosophy flourished. Athens was the birthplace of Western art traditions, and living there would allow me to witness the creation of sculptures like Discobolus and architectural beauties like the Parthenon. I’d also experience the first tragedies and comedies in theater or literature from Aristophanes, Sophocles, and Euripides. These weren’t mere entertainers, but rather providers of emotional and political experiences. Finally, Socrates was challenging people’s assumptions about life during this time, with Plato and Aristotle coming after. Being able to surround myself with the earlier forms of critical thought and discussion intrigues me. Although this was a period that wasn’t perfect, as a creative and critical thinker, I would love to travel back in time for this experience.>",
        "<The best conversation I’ve ever had is with a5719. I was torn between pursuing product design, something I loved, and product management, which seemed like the more lucrative, 'correct' choice. In my current occupancy relevant to this conversation, this role furthered my internal feeling of needing to aim high, in salary and recognition. But through my conversation, I realized I was chasing what I thought I deserved, rather than what I wanted. All that truly matters is where my heart lies, not external perception or factors. He reminded me that my career decision should be grounded in passion, and that my genuine love for product design was valid and reason enough.>",

        "<I guess the medium would be visual art? The greatest contribution to art I have ever seen is the Can’t Help Myself 2016 piece by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu, who designed an industrial robot programmed to sweep a blood-like substance perfectly in a circle but then stop working at the very last second and mimic dance movements, causing the blood to splatter again and forcing the robot to repeat the action for eternity. It only lasted 3 years functionally and “died” at the end but it’s such a good representation of Sisyphean tasks and I wish people just immediately knew what I was on about because it perfectly describes this loop people seem to be stuck in of endless work until you essentially fall apart. That’s not to say I don’t fall pray to the Can’t Help Myself effect, if you will. It’s incredibly hard to stop working, take a proper break that isn’t just half a TV show while I’m eating takeout or go to an event where I’m not just trying to network or show that I’m responsible enough for a titled position. Every action people seem to take nowadays is backed by clinical utility. Even going to a museum or exploring the city has to be this weirdly Instagrammable function to be ready for consumption. Unlike a lot of art and a lot of news, this robot really swayed people with its messaging, and it’s a very modern lesson that I, among many others, need to learn.>",

        "<I have this value that I like to call my SherlockBBC theory. It sums up to a conversation Watson and Sherlock have where Watson goes “Sherlock, there’s no way you don’t know that the Sun doesn’t revolve around the Earth, it’s the Earth that revolves around the sun!” He responds something along the lines of “it doesn’t matter if I know it or not, it’ll still revolve either way.” This is how I view paleontology. Honestly, I love seeing dinosaurs at the museum or hearing my friends rattle off facts, but I don’t find the study of history before the Anthropocene all that compelling. Astronomy, on the other hand, has always held a dearer place in my heart. When I was little, my father used to make up explanations for the stars, which turned into my brother educating me on the chemistry of it all. As I grew up, it became a silly thing my friends referred to when talking about horoscopes and planetary alignment causing their boy problems and now that everything has changed I’m far away from everyone, I revel in the constant presence of stars. Even in this light-polluted city, at least I know they are still there. I think I’m also just obsessed with planetariums and those old-timey documentaries about space (although I never want to be on a spaceship). My favorite museum display ever is the American Natural History Museum’s size reference walk-around. It basically puts everything into perspective from an atom to a galaxy and is the place I always suggest people go to when they’re tweaking out a little too much. Astronomy reminds me that in the grand scheme of things, it’ll all be okay. Paleontology has cool dinosaurs though.>",
        "<I would want to live in the Gupta Empire in Ancient India. First of all, it’s the literal Golden Age of India that sounds fire, I would want to read all the Sanskrit books I could find and learn all that I could about traditional ways of living since so much of Indian history was destroyed during British occupation. I truly wonder how women were treated, what civility looked like, what fashion and culture and food would have been like, completely unaffected by British occupation’s tainting and rewriting. I also just really enjoy little things like speaking Hindi and wearing saris, and bigger things like having a very strong sense of community over American individualism, although I do greatly benefit from the whole “American Dream” independence and mindset here.>",
        "<The best conversation I ever had was in March of my senior year, when my depression was especially bad and after almost seven years, I finally asked my mom for help. It was consequently the hardest conversation of my life, since in my mother’s eyes, mental health was the sort of thing you worried about when you didn’t have real problems to deal with. It’s not that she didn’t believe that I was suffering, she just didn’t believe my actual doctor-given diagnosis, and opted to believe it was because I didn’t eat enough vegetables and didn’t sleep enough. She saw all the symptoms of depression–– my inability to eat or sleep or find joy in anything–– and wrote it off as simply not listening to her. It’s a very hard place to be in when someone wants to be right more than they want to help you. Not to be sad and emo but getting to the point: That march I learned that the reason she was so adamant that I was wrong was because she had depression too. Which sounds silly, because you’d think it would make her more likely to believe me. She ended up explaining that what she went through during depressive episodes was so painful that it was too much to admit I was experiencing the same thing, likely as a result of genetics. I realized it was never me versus her, but us versus our problems. I think she and I both realized how difficult this conversation had been for us and though my mother and I are still rocky on a lot of things, since then, she’s never made it hard for me to open up to her. She asks how I’m doing often and I ask how she is in return. It was the best thing to ever come out of a conversation.>",

        "<A house integrated into an existing canyon, a museum built into the landscape - every piece of organic architecture also has a subliminal message about having a more sustainable world. Frank Lloyd Wright is one whose the 'father' to this type of design and philosophy in art, where the buildings themselves are so specific,, every little detail intentionally designed not to harm the environment as much as possible, and having architecture integrated into the natural landscape. When I mean specific I mean interior from floors and doors to furniture and natural surroundings, all components relate to one another creating what Wright called a 'unified organism.' It's a relatively new medium starting from the early 1900s. As our society progresses,, I believe its message will have more sound and meaning.From a young age, I've loved nature. I grew up in the south where behind my backyard is a beautiful view, trees and a lake I could see, so I've always appreciated nature and its beauty. Sometimes I'd see land being flattened out for there to be houses all similar looking to each other to be built. In my little kid eyes, I thought it was like destroying beauty for bland houses to be built instead. That's why I've always admired organic architecture and its complementary design with nature and society. Wright's Fallingwater is one of my faviorte houses ever made of all time. Instead of making a house overlooking a waterfall, he built it sitting on top of it so it blended with the natural surroundings, with terraces of local sandstone that blend with the rock formations. It's what I wish more architecture would do and what I wish my house would look like one day.>",
        "<'Attention is All You Need' by Noam Shazeer and his colleagues changed everything. Before the Transformer, AI language models processed text sequentially - one word after another in a linear fashion. These old models (like RNNs and LSTMs) couldn't easily connect ideas that were far apart in a text, kind of like trying to remember the beginning of a long paragraph by the time you reach the end. The Transformer architecture broke that chain, letting AI grasp relationships between all words simultaneously. When I first understood this concept, I literally stayed up until 3 AM reading the paper and proceeding to Amazon to buy more books about neural network architectures.The human story behind the paper is one that goes hand in hand. Google executives repeatedly shelved Shazeer's chatbot proposal despite its potential. Rather than compromise his vision, he walked away from one of tech's most coveted positions to build Character AI. Now Google has paid 2.7 billion cash deal to license Character AI. It reminds me of those moments in tech history - like Apple's board pushing out Jobs, only to beg for his return years later. The courage to bet on yourself when no one else will? That's rare. Without Shazeer's paper and his refusal to give up, we wouldn't have any of the AI tools transforming our world today. One brilliant idea/mind, ignored by a tech giant, paving the current wave of technology.>",
        "<Astronomy is both enlightening and incredibly humbling. The atoms in our bodies were formed in the cores of stars. Every fiber of our being is connected to the universe and yet we know so little about the universe. The pure size of the universe and our lack of knowledge about what's out there, livable planets, new materials, other intelligent life. It's a big chance for humans to reach the next age if you will. Because it's a mystery. Similar to why things like unsolved mysteries or conspiracy theories are so popular because it's a real life mystery. In school it's almost like we've learned that everything has a direct correct answer but there's so many unanswered questions in so many things to still be explored. So many things that don't line up and so many things that just shouldn't be.>",
        "<The Abbasid caliphate during the Islamic Golden Age would be my choice - I've always been fascinated by how so many fundamental scientific concepts we take for granted today were being discovered for the first time back then. This period witnessed unprecedented scientific advancement that fundamentally shaped our modern understanding of mathematics, optics, and medicine. Al-Khwarizmi's development of algebra established mathematical foundations we still rely upon today. The creation of the astrolabe (invented alongside a woman, which was remarkable for that era), discovered Snell's Law about the refraction of light, and revolutionized medicine with Al-Zahrawi's surgical instruments like scalpels, curettes, retractors, and specula, and utilized catgut for sutures (fun side note I dressed up as him for Halloween). Similar to my viewpoint now, I want to be a part of the Abbasid empire since it's where scientific discovery is happening and occurring. Even now I like being in the same city of where new innovation is happening. If I'd have to choose one, I'd like to see the foundation of how lots of our science was made by living in the Abbasid empire. The House of Wisdom in Baghdad wasn't just some dusty old library - it was like the ultimate think tank where brilliant minds from different backgrounds collaborated on groundbreaking ideas. Being there to witness these discoveries firsthand would be like watching history unfold in real-time, seeing the building blocks of modern science being laid one breakthrough at a time.>",
        "<My best friend and I sat away from everyone else in a darkly lit room at 4 AM. Talked about death in each other's lives and the meaning to their deaths. This then evolved into talking about predeterminism. Talking about death led us to talking about existentialism and predeterminism. I'm also of the mind who loves analytics. I see almost everything in the world works with math down to simple particle movement can be estimated and determined by math equations and so can our position relative to the whole universe. The concept that all events are causally linked, with each event being the necessary result of preceding events, can be mathematically represented and modeled. Like the Law of Excluded Middle: this principle, a cornerstone of logic, states that any proposition is either true or false. Some argue that this suggests a pre-determined outcome, as the future is already either true or false, even if we don't know what that truth is. We then talked about as far as we know, ur life doesn't have an analytical reason - we just exist. Our life probably didn't mean anything (of course insomnia was not influencing this conversation). So, how do we actually make the most of life? After having this deep conversation (and also having a mini existential crisis too), made us understand that at the end of the day we want to leave an impact on this earth and that we want to do something great in this world so that we have a legacy that outlasts our lives even if our life means nothing in the grand cosmos it'll mean something to others after we pass.>",
