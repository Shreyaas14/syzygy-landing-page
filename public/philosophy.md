> In astronomy,  **_syzygy_** is defined as a collinear configuration of three celestial bodies—in other words, the alignment of three objects in space.

We align our collective around holding three astral pursuits to the highest esteem: Research, Application, and Ideation.

- **Research** serves as discovery—new ways to define phenomena in our still unknown reality.  
- **Application** serves as execution on research or other ideals/philosophies—exploring the parameters of discovery in our imperfect, irrational reality.  
- **Ideation** serves as a unique bridge between research and application, still in its own domain—determining how provide value to humanity in our evolving reality.

These three pursuits structure our offerings, housed in a **Library** for the soul, a **Warehouse** for the mind, a **Museum** for the eyes, and a **Record Room** for the ears.

We, the collective, exist at the union **{ research ∪ application ∪ ideation }**, with the express purpose of creating an interdisciplinary model of the world. We seek truth together—combining minds as artists, builders, makers, and scientists. We recognize the absurd unique phenomenological beauty of life, aligning here, at one corner of vast universe, whether it be simulation, or the singularity.

**Syzygy Technologies** exists as the culmination of our progress, displayed for the world to see and learn from.
